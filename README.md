# Password Cracker
Character-level **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Net) **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) text predictor intended for password generation research.

[Password Cracker - Generating Passwords with Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs)ðŸ”‘ðŸ”“](https://towardsdatascience.com/password-cracker-generating-passwords-with-recurrent-neural-networks-lstms-9583714a3310)


## Disclaimer
This project was developed for purely educational use. Don't use it for any evil purposes.

## Idea
1. Given a large dataset of leaked passwords.
2. Train an **RNN LSTM** model on it.
3. Generate new passwords.

## Data
[Top 85 million WPA (Wi-Fi) Passwords](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists/tree/master/Real-Passwords/WPA-Length)

Randomized and split into:

* **Training set (10%)** ~100 MB (9 M passwords)
* **Testing set (90%)** ~850 MB (76 M passwords)


## Implementation
[**Text Predictor RNN LSTM**](https://github.com/gsurma/text_predictor), for more details check this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-predictor-generating-rap-lyrics-with-recurrent-neural-networks-lstms-c3a1acbbda79). 


## Hyperparameters
	Batch size: 32
	Sequence length: 25
	Learning rate: 0.002
	Decay rate: 0.97
	Hidden layer size: 1024
	Cells size: 3


## Results

`hit_ratio = sampled_passwords_in_test_set / all_sampled_passwords`


After 100 thousands of learning iterations, RNN LSTM model generated **896** passwords and **119** of them were in the validation set. 

It means that **13%** of the generated password were *the real ones*.
